# classify-images-with-gcp-autoML


AutoML Vision helps developers with limited ML expertise train high quality image recognition models. Once you upload images to the AutoML UI, you can train a model that will be immediately available on Google Cloud for generating predictions via an easy to use REST API.

In this lab you will upload images to Cloud Storage and use them to train a custom model to recognize different types of clouds (cumulus, cumulonimbus, etc.).
