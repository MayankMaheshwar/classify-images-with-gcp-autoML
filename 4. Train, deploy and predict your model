You're ready to start training your model! AutoML Vision handles this for you automatically, without requiring you to write any of the model code.

To train your clouds model, go to the Train tab and click Start Training.

Enter a name for your model, or use the default auto-generated name.

Leave Cloud-hosted selected, then click Continue.
Click Start Training.


Deploy your model
Now it's time for the most important part: generating predictions on your trained model using data it hasn't seen before.

Navigate to the Test & Use tab in the AutoML UI:
Deploy model then Deploy.



Generate predictions
There are a few ways to generate predictions. In this lab you'll use the UI to upload images. You'll see how your model does classifying these two images (the first is a cirrus cloud, the second is a cumulonimbus).
Return to the AutoML Vision UI, click Upload Images and upload the clouds to the online prediction UI. When the prediction request completes you should see something like the following:
