Set up AutoML Vision

From the Navigation menu, select APIs & Services > Library.

In the search bar type in "Cloud AutoML". Click on the Cloud AutoML API result and then click Enable.


In Cloud Shell use the following commands to create environment variables for you Project ID and Username, replacing <USERNAME> with the User Name you logged into the lab with:

export PROJECT_ID=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
export QWIKLABS_USERNAME=<USERNAME>
Run the following command to give AutoML permissions:

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member="user:$QWIKLABS_USERNAME" \
    --role="roles/automl.admin"
Now create a storage bucket by running the following:

gsutil mb -p $PROJECT_ID \
    -c standard    \
    -l us-central1 \
    gs://$PROJECT_ID-vcm/
