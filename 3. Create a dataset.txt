Now that your training data is in Cloud Storage, you need a way for AutoML Vision to access it. You'll create a CSV file where each row contains a URL to a training image and the associated label for that image. This CSV file has been created for you; you just need to update it with your bucket name.

Run the following command to copy the file to your Cloud Shell instance:

gsutil cp gs://spls/gsp223/data.csv .


Then update the CSV with the files in your project:

sed -i -e "s/placeholder/${BUCKET}/g" ./data.csv

Now upload this file to your Cloud Storage bucket:

gsutil cp ./data.csv gs://${BUCKET}


Navigate back to the AutoML Vision tab

At the top of the console, click + NEW DATASET.

Type "clouds" for the Dataset name.

Select "Single-Label Classification".

Click Create Dataset.

Choose Select a CSV file on Cloud Storage and add the file name to the URL for the file you just uploaded - gs://your-bucket-name/data.csv
